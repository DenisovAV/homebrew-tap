  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      `convert` and `verify` build their own environments on first use and pull
      several GB, including torch. `prepare`, `tune` and `bundle` do not.

      On Linux the runtime needs libvulkan1 -- litert-lm dlopen()s a
      Vulkan-linked library even for the CPU backend:
        sudo apt-get install -y libvulkan1
    EOS

    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/litetune --version")

    # `shell_output` raises unless the exit status matches, so this line is the
    # assertion. Exit 4 is "could not check", which is what a usage error must
    # produce here: 2 already means "measured, inconclusive", and a typo is not
    # a measurement.
